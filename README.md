# Integrating ngMessages on inputs to manage error state

## Objectives

- Include ngMessages submodule
- Use ngMessages to compose different validation messages

## Instructions

In this repo, we have a form that needs error messages displayed for its validation rules.

Add the `ngMessages` module to our app (the file is already included), and then add the validation errors by using `ngMessages`.
